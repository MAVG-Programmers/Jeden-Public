Project Jeden
=====
Project Jeden is a videogame developed by a group of redditors 
from [/r/MakeAVideoGame](http://reddit.com/r/MakeAVideoGame). 
It's a project intended to prove that an unorganized group of 
redditors with wildly varying amounts of skill and experience 
can come together and work as peers to produce an awesome game.

Jeden uses the SFML library with .NET and a physics engine 
called Farseer. The whole game is done in C# and only
supports windows at the moment. Although porting to other platforms should be possible.
