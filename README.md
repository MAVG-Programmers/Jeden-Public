Jeden
=====
Jeden is a project developed by a group of people from the 
internet forum [reddit.com](http://reddit.com/r/makeavideogame).
This is a game that is developed by different people around the world 

The game uses the SFML library with .Net and a physics
engine called Farseer. The whole game is done in C# and thus only
support windows at the moment. Some people in the group suggest 
that we add support for the game to run under `mono`.

Build
=====
The project is a complete project for Visual Studio 2012.
Open it and press `Build`.

Install
=======
The game has no installer at the moment, see build instructions.
