Setting GameOject position - this doesn't really work with PhysicsComponents since the physics component will just overwrite the position.

Game state initialization -  GameState gets some of it's managers set by GameEngine but this is after the constructor is called. Needs an Initialize function or something.

Components without Managers. Need to update these in GameObject, but not update those with managers. Should a component with a manager hold a refrence to it's manger?
This way if the Manager is not null, it is known to have a manager. This would make things like deletion of GameObjects easier as well.

GameTime - TimeSpan.Milliseconds is deceptive as it is not fine enough. If you sum the Milliseconds for a second it will be much less than 1000, often it returns 0s.
Should this not be exposed(I'm new to C# so it might just be me)? I've already made this error and I just noticed it in HealthComponent...

Dictionary of components - Mapping a Type to a component is confusing if there a heirarchy of components for a subsystem. It also limits 
GameObjects to 1 of each component type. For example I may want a RenderComponent and a DebugRenderComponent, but without making 2 classes.
Refrence by string or something seems to make more sense.

Controllers - Lots of controllers for each component or a few monolithic master controllers?
