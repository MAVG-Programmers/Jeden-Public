Setting GameOject position - this doesn't really work with PhysicsComponents since the physics component will just overwrite the position.

Game state initialization -  GameState gets some of it's managers set by GameEngine but this is after the constructor is called. Needs an Initialize function or something.

Components without Managers. Need to update these in GameObject, but not update those with managers. Should a component with a manager hold a refrence to it's manger?
This way if the Manager is not null, it is known to have a manager. This would make things like deletion of GameObjects easier as well.

GameTime - TimeSpan.Milliseconds is deceptive as it if ofter 0, or if you sum the Milliseconds for a second it will be much less than 1000.
Should this not be exposed(I'm new to C# so it might just be me). I've already made this error and I just noticed it in HealthComponent...]
