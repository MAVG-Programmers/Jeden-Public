Setting GameOject position - this doesn't really work with PhysicsComponents since the physics component will just overwrite the position.

Game state initialization -  GameState gets some of it's managers set by GameEngine but this is after the constructor is called. Needs an Initialize function or something.

GameTime - TimeSpan.Milliseconds is deceptive as it is not fine enough. If you sum the Milliseconds for a second it will be much less than 1000, often it returns 0s.
Should this not be exposed(I'm new to C# so it might just be me)? I've already made this error and I just noticed it in HealthComponent...

Controllers - Lots of controllers for each component or a few monolithic master controllers?
